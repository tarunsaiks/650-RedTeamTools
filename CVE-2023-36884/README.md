This Python script generates an RTF file with default content, adds a linked OLE object with a URL to the RTF file, and inserts the RTF file as an altChunk into a DOCX document.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install python-docx pywin32
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the script with the following command:

    ```bash
    python test.py <doc_file> <rtf_file> <ole_objects_url>
    ```

    Replace `<doc_file>` with the path to the DOCX file where you want to insert the RTF content.
    Replace `<rtf_file>` with the desired path for the generated RTF file.
    Replace `<ole_objects_url>` with the URL of the OLE object to be linked.

2. The script will generate the RTF file, add the linked OLE object to it, and insert it as an altChunk into the specified DOCX file.

3. Once the script completes execution, the RTF file will be added as an altChunk to the DOCX file.

**Note:**
- Ensure that you have appropriate permissions to create and modify files in the specified directories.
- Make sure to provide valid paths and URLs as command-line arguments.
