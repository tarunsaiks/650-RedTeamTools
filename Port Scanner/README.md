Uses `socket` library to make TCP connections and based on the response, the port can be considered either **OPEN** or **CLOSE**

## Usage:
`chmod +x code.py`

# Portscanning and Service Detection in Python

## A fully functional portscanning tool which can detect open port along with the service running on it!

This project was built using Python through the implementation of a couple of Python libraries like socket, sys, and datetime. Basically, the program can scan the intended target, both by IP address and domain name, and determine the service running on it

# Usage:

## Method 1

### Prerequisites

We need to have python file reader i.e IDLE, Pycharm, etc installed in our PC.

Step: Then simply running a file takes us to the Input the target address in the textfield.

## Method 2 by using linux terminal

### Prerequisites

We need to have python installed in our linux environment.

Step 1: We need to make the file executable.

`chmod  +x <filename>.py`

Step 2: Running the execuitable file, then we we land on portscanning page which will ask us to enter the domain or IP address.

#Future Improvements

1. Add version detection functionality.

2. Implement exploit detection based on detected versions.

3. Develop a GUI-based interface for enhanced user-friendliness.
