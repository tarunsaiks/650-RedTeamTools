## Questions

Answer the following questions about your tool. Your answers should be thorough and fully answer the question. Answers should be grammatically correct and be full sentences.

### (8 points) What is the goal of this tool? What purpose does it bring to the competitions?

The goal of my script is twofold. Firstly, it streamlines the secure transfer of Excel files from a remote server to a local directory, employing the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) via SSH. Secondly, it incorporates an infinite loop to iteratively launch a calculator application at intervals.

In the organizational context, the script serves to automate the retrieval of Excel files from a remote server, offering efficiency in data synchronization, backups, or other data-related operations. While the inclusion of an infinite loop launching a calculator application might seem unconventional and lacks a clear organizational purpose, it could potentially serve as a placeholder for testing or maintaining system activity during competitions.

### (8 points) Did other tools influence your tool? If so, what are they? If not, what was your inspiration for the tool?

I crafted this script with limited influence from specific tools. The necessity of securely transferring files using SCP is a common requirement in various scripting scenarios. The decision to include the calculator application in an infinite loop might have been influenced by the desire to simulate continuous activity on a system or as a placeholder for testing purposes.

Standard scripting practices and my familiarity with file transfer protocols, such as SCP and SSH, played a more significant role in shaping the script's functionality.

### (8 points) What is the feasibility of another team member quickly learning to use or contribute to your tool? What makes it easy or difficult to learn?

The feasibility of another team member swiftly learning and contributing to the script depends on their familiarity with shell scripting and the specific tools and protocols employed, such as SCP and SSH.

For the file transfer component, a foundational understanding of basic shell scripting, SSH, and SCP commands would be advantageous. The script's structure is intentionally kept simple, featuring clear variable definitions and function calls for ease of comprehension and modification.

However, the introduction of the calculator application in an infinite loop may pose a potential distraction from the primary purpose of the script. To enhance learnability and contribute to ease, comprehensive documentation, clear explanations of the script's purpose and components, and discussions on the calculator application's inclusion and potential alternatives would be beneficial for team members.
